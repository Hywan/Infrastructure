# Service: nginx

[nginx](http://nginx.org/) is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy
server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server.

On a [FSH](http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml) system, nginx will be
installed in the `/etc/nginx/` directory. To control the service, the
[`systemctl`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemctl.html)
command can be used.

The `/var/www/` directory contains all the Web applications that nginx is likely
to serve.
